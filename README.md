//Creating a smart parking system using a Raspberry Pi is more complex than a simple Arduino setup due to the need for image processing and computer vision. In this example, I'll show you how to create a basic smart parking system using a Raspberry Pi, a Raspberry Pi Camera module, and Python. This code will detect whether a parking spot is occupied or vacant based on the camera feed.

//Here's a step-by-step guide:

//Hardware Setup:

//Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS installed
//Raspberry Pi Camera module
//Internet connection (optional but useful for remote monitoring)
//Install Required Libraries:
//Before starting, make sure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip.

pip install opencv-python
pip install opencv-python-headless

//Running the Code:

//Save the code to a Python file (e.g., smart_parking.py).
//Make sure the Raspberry Pi is connected to the Raspberry Pi Camera module.
//Run the code on your Raspberry Pi: python smart_parking.py.
//The code will use the camera feed to detect parking spot occupancy and display the result on the screen.
